This is a (currently experimental) standalone BSON implementation for C++.

The code is adapted from the MongoDB C++ driver.  It is effectively forked and 
will be quite different, especially over time.  All mongodb references are 
eliminated, as the goal here was to create a "pure bson" library that is as 
simple as reasonably possible.

The namespace is (currently) _bson.  "bson" was not used as it is anticipated
there may be a more official bson library from someone else at some point, 
and don't want to have a namespace collision.

The BSONObj class has been simplified and all container/smart pointer functionality
eliminated.  It is renamed bsonobj to make it more clear that this is "different"
than the old mongo::BSONObj class.

All third party dependencies are eliminated, everything you need should be in 
this one directory.  To avoid a dependency upon boost, the current version uses 
the C++11 unique_ptr class.  If you want to use older C++, just include the appropriate
boost header, or, refactor to auto_ptr.
